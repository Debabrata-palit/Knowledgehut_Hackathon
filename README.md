**Loan Repayment Assessment in Banking**  
This GitHub repository contains a data science project focused on assessing loan repayment using machine learning models. The project aims to predict whether a customer will repay a loan based on various features and historical data.

# Project Overview
In this project, we leverage data science techniques to analyze banking data and build predictive models to determine the likelihood of loan repayment. By utilizing historical loan data, we aim to develop models that assist in making informed lending decisions.

# Outcome
In the end of the project the output file [test_loan_results.csv](https://github.com/Debabrata-palit/Knowledgehut_Hackathon/blob/main/test_loan_results.csv) has been extracted where we can see which Loan is paid and which one is defaulted from the test loan dataset.
